Doppler imaging code for late-type stars.

This code was developed for mapping of late-type stars surfaces by spectral line profiles set. The idea of stellar surface reconstruction is based on partitioning the surface into large number of elementar areas and searching such a brightness distribution which fits the observed line profiles.
